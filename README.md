# MauiAppTestNfcAndroid

This project is a simplified port (for now only for the Android part) of my old project written with Xamarin:
https://github.com/acaliaro/XamarinDemoNfc

The differences between MAUI and Xamarin are minimal as all development is done in the platform specific part.
I haven't ported the iOS part but I think that even in this case you can directly use the Xamarin project code and port it to the platform specific part
